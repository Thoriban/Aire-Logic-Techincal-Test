# Aire-Logic-Techincal-Test
Technical Test for stage 2 of the Aire Logic interview process

The Aire Logic Technical Test Programme is a c# console application that takes name of one or multiple artists
and returns the average number of words in the artist's songs.  If multiple artists have been selected
the program will also compare the artist's averages and declare which has the higher average word count.

## Installation
Extract the Zip file to your desired location. Navigate to ../AireLogic Technical Test/bin/Release/netcoreapp3.1/ and
run the Aire Logic Techincal Test.exe executable file.

## Roadmap
To further develop this program, I would add a dataset for the artist information gained from the MusicBrainz API
and request more information using mutliple queries to allow for the collection of album data in order to compare 
release schedules between artists at varying points throughout their career's.

Additionally, I would replace the command line side of the application with a web interface that would display the
search software and allow for the visualisation of the artist's data in the form of charts relating to the average 
word count of songs for a given time frame, comparing an artist's works across certain periods of their career.
